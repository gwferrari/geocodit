# geocodit project

Geocodit is a system that manages a [geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding) knowledge base according W3C semantic web best practices and standards.

geocodit exposes:

- a language profile description to be used to map geocoding data in RDF
- a set of gateways to transform  some 3 star linked data into five stars linked data compliant with geocodit language profile  
- a forward geocoder that leverages the  knowledge base and other geocoding services (e.g. Google Map's and OSM) to produce accurate results; 
- a benchmark API that compares the performances of various geocoder
- a shareable knowledge base description to be used to populate a graph database with all needed geocoding information (LinkedData.Center ingestion APIs required)

geocodit was thinked for the italian territory but can be easily adaped to other geographies.
